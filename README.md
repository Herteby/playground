# Meteor + Grapher + Vue
This is my testing project and demo for [grapher-vue](https://github.com/Herteby/grapher-vue).

It's got a pretty neat infinite scroll feature, combining grapher-vue with Akryum's [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller)

[Live demo](https://dev.herte.by/) or:
```
git clone https://github.com/Herteby/testing.git
cd testing
npm install
meteor
```
[If you don't have Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
