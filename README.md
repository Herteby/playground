# Meteor + Grapher + Vue
This is my testing project for [grapher-vue](https://github.com/Herteby/grapher-vue). It serves as a good demo for how it works.

It's got a pretty cool infinite scroll feature, combining grapher-vue with Akryum's [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller)

```
git clone https://github.com/Herteby/testing.git
cd testing
npm install
meteor
```
